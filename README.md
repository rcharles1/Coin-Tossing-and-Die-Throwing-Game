# Gambling-Game
A Django web application that offers an interactive gambling experience by simulating the tossing of a coin and throwing of a six-sided die.
The game is designed around two classic elements of chance: the toss of a coin and the roll of a six-sided die. Upon entering the game, 
players are required to make a payment of at least two million shillings. The game begins with the player tossing a virtual coin. If the landing side is "Heads", the player proceeds with throwing dice
and wins the equivalent of the landing side in millions, and then the game is over. If the landing side is "Tails", a player gets three more trials.
